encapsulation

and withdraw(double amount) to deposit and withdraw money from the account, respectively. 
The methods should check if the balance is sufficient before performing the transaction and update the balance accordingly.

inheritance
1. Create a class named "Shape" with two double type instance variables "width" and "height". 
Create a subclass named "Rectangle" that inherits from the "Shape" class 
and has a method named "calculateArea()" that returns the area of the rectangle (width * height).
 Create an object of the "Rectangle" class and call its "calculateArea()" method.


polymorphism
1. Create a Person class with a greet method that prints "Hello, I am a person". 
Create a Teacher and Student class that extend Person and override the greet method to print "Hello, I am a teacher" 
and "Hello, I am a student" respectively. 
Create a Main class that has an array of Person objects and loop through the array to call the greet method on each object.
